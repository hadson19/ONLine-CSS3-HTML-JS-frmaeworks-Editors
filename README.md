[JSBIN](http://jsbin.com/?html,js,output). JSBin was created and is actively maintained by well-respected developer Remy Sharp. The idea to develop it came from the need to collaborate interactively with other developers to debug JavaScript code. It has since matured into a robust tool which:

Allows groups of developers to work together to solve code problems
Serves as a sort of bin that developers can go back to reference
Makes sharing code and solutions incredibly easy
JSBin is also opensource licensed under the liberal MIT license allowing community members to freely contribute to it or fork it to create their own customized solutions.
